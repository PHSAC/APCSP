		<p>Junior year is a big year for students and I have barely been making it through. I have had a lot of trouble with my parents expectations and one of my teachers teaching style. It has all round been stressful for me and I hope my mental health can recover.</p>

		<p>My favorite story is Come Catastrophes or Wakes of Vultures, however, if it needs to have a cover it would be Source Code by Bill Gates. Source Code is an autobiography and reflection of Bill Gates childhood and coding throughout his life. Come Catastrophes or Wakes of Vultures on the other hand is an allegory to the US government removal of rural American settlements. It is a short read but packs a punch and has probably the funniest yet meaningful climax to a story that I have ever read. I would highly reccomend both if you are looking for a story to read (Come Catastrophes can be read on the Arknights story reader website).</p>
